# Determining Term Life Insurance

This project analyzes the factors that influence how much term life insurance individuals purchase, using a cleaned dataset of survey responses. I explored the impact of family characteristicsâ€”such as marital status, number of dependents, income, and ageâ€”on insurance decisions. Using data analysis and visualization techniques in Python, I identified key trends and built predictive models to better understand purchasing behavior. The goal was to provide insights that could help insurers and policyholders make more informed decisions.
